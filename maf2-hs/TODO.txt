TODO
=====


General
-------

- [ ] fix modf worklist algorithm
- [ ] clean-up 
     * Add documentation in more places
     * Remove the `Cap` system. It might not be needed after all because we have MonadLayer
     * Look at the directory structure see if it can be made more clear
     * Write a tutorial on how to implement a very small toy language (such as an ANF abstract interpreter)

Python Analysis
---------------

- [ ] implement setattr
- [ ] expose setattr as a primitive function
- [ ] expose getattr as a primitive function
- [ ] fix intra analysis function for Python
- [ ] implement superclasses and linearisation
- [ ] provide syntax support for super classes, perhaps with some magic variable 
      inside the body of a method that gives access to the current value in the linearisation of `self`. 
- [ ] implementation of data descriptors
- [ ] EVERYTHING is an object: remove the modular python value and wrap everything inside an object (i.e. we can assign 
      attributes to a function object)
- [ ] some values do not support mutation: integers and strings do not support it. So their setattr function should
      always fail with an AttributError
